# Security Scanning Permissions Fix

## 🚨 Critical Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Trivy SARIF upload failing with permission error:
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration - https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-a-workflow-run
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issue:**
The GitHub Actions workflows lacked the necessary permissions to upload security scan results (SARIF files) to the GitHub Security tab.

### **Required Permissions Missing:**
- `security-events: write` - Required to upload SARIF files to security tab
- `actions: read` - Required for workflow run access
- `contents: read` - Required for repository access

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **1. Fixed Security Workflow Permissions**
**File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      actions: read
      contents: read
    steps:
```

### **2. Fixed Docker Workflow Permissions**
**File**: `.github/workflows/docker.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    steps:
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      security-events: write
      actions: read
    steps:
```

### **3. Added Dedicated CodeQL Workflow**
**File**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

```yaml
name: CodeQL Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, dev ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday at 2 AM

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'python' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      with:
        category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
```

## 📊 Permission Matrix

| Workflow | Contents | Packages | Security Events | Actions | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `tests.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Unit testing |
| `quality.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Code quality |
| `security.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ✅ write | ✅ read | Security scanning |
| `docker.yml` | ✅ read | ✅ write | ✅ write | ✅ read | Docker + security |
| `integration.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Integration tests |
| `release.yml` | ✅ write | ✅ write | ❌ | ❌ | Package release |
| `docs.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Documentation |
| `codeql.yml` | ✅ read | ❌ | ✅ write | ✅ read | CodeQL analysis |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Permission Requirements Explained**

#### **`security-events: write`**
- **Purpose**: Allows uploading SARIF files to GitHub Security tab
- **Used by**: Trivy scans, CodeQL analysis
- **Required for**: `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`

#### **`actions: read`**
- **Purpose**: Allows reading workflow run information
- **Used by**: Security scanning actions for telemetry
- **Required for**: Workflow run access and status reporting

#### **`contents: read`**
- **Purpose**: Allows reading repository contents
- **Used by**: All workflows for code checkout
- **Required for**: `actions/checkout@v4`

#### **`packages: write`**
- **Purpose**: Allows publishing packages to GitHub Container Registry
- **Used by**: Docker workflow for image publishing
- **Required for**: `docker/build-push-action@v5`

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration - https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-a-workflow-run
Warning: Caught an exception while gathering information for telemetry
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Uploading code scanning results
Processing sarif files: ["trivy-results.sarif"]
Validating trivy-results.sarif
Adding fingerprints to SARIF file
Successfully uploaded SARIF file
```
